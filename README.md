This assignment converts the activity on this link:

https://github.com/nina-mir/CSC317-assignments/tree/main/activities/todo-API-in-memoryLinks to an external site.

to include a SQLite database in the backend to store all the todo-items. 

Basically, all the GET, POST, DELETE operations happens on the backend instead of an in-memory array on the server. 
By having a database in the backend, your app will have persistent behavior and won't  re-set the data as it is doing in its current in-memory form.
